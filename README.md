# Yet Another Fractal Explorer!

This is my Final Degree Project made at Universitat de Barcelona for the Double degree in Mathematics and Computer Science!

This is an application that allows you to explore the fractals from Mandelbrot (and Multibrot) sets and Julia sets as well as some 3D fractals such as the Mandelbulb or some IFS fractals directly on a [website!](https://adry26.github.io/YetAnotherFractalExplorer/)

In addition, you can find on [releases](https://github.com/adry26/YetAnotherFractalExplorer/releases/latest) the binaries for an enhanced MacOS version of this software! Windows and Linux binaries are comming soon.

We also plan to release an iOS and Android application of this software.
